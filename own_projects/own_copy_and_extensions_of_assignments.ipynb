    "# Lesson 4 - Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for natural language processing tasks. It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."

      "Sure! Here are 3 usability improvements to make your conversation with the OpenAI API easier:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create a function to handle the submission to GPT:\n",
      "Instead of calling `add_to_context` and `submit_to_gpt` separately, you can create a single function that handles both adding to the message log and submitting to GPT. This way, you don't have to type as much. Here's an example:\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Store the model name and role as constants:\n",
      "Instead of hardcoding the model name and role in the function, you can define them as constants at the beginning of your code. This way, if you ever need to change them, you can do it in one place. Here's an example:\n",
      "```python\n",

      "You can then use these constants in your functions instead of hardcoding the values.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use f-strings for string formatting:\n",
      "You can use f-strings for string formatting to make your code cleaner and easier to read. Here's an example:\n",
      "```python\n",
